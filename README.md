- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmcgui10
- 👀 I’m interested in web3 development and the intersection with law and policy, plus building cool shit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidity (slowly) and relearning core software development skills after 10 years of practicing law.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything DAO governance-related or iterative improvements to using smart contracts to promote broader wealth creation.
- 📫 How to reach me... Twitter @maddawg_eth; Instagram @maddawg.eth
